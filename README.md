# TO-DO
<h2>Project Description</h2>
This is the first challenge of Rocketseat's 'Ignite' course, called TO-DO. The project was developed using ReactJS with TypeScript and created with Vite, offering a modern and efficient development experience.

The goal of TO-DO is to enable users to organize their daily activities in a personalized list. With this application, users can add new tasks, mark activities as completed, and also delete tasks that are no longer needed.
